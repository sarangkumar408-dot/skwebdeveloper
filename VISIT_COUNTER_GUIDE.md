# Website Visit Counter - Implementation Guide

## Overview
I've successfully implemented a comprehensive website visit counter system for your SK Web Solutions website. The system tracks visitor counts, stores visit history, and provides detailed analytics in the admin panel.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Public Visitor Counter**
- Displays total visitor count on the homepage (in the hero stats section)
- Animated counter that smoothly counts up when the page loads
- Updates in real-time as new visitors arrive

### 2. **Visit Tracking System**
- Automatically tracks each website visit
- Prevents duplicate counting (same visitor within 30 minutes)
- Records useful information:
  - Timestamp of visit
  - Anonymized IP hash (for privacy)
  - Browser/user agent
  - Referrer source
  - Session ID

### 3. **Admin Analytics Dashboard**
Located in the admin panel (admin.html), accessible after login:

**Statistics Summary:**
- Total visits (all time)
- Today's visits
- This week's visits
- This month's visits
- Unique visitors count

**Visit History Table:**
- Detailed list of all visits
- Shows date/time, visitor ID, browser, and referrer
- Pagination for easy navigation through history
- Ability to refresh data
- Option to clear all visit history

## How It Works

### Backend (server.js)
The server provides three main API endpoints:

1. **GET /api/visits** - Returns visit statistics
   - Calculates daily, weekly, monthly totals
   - Provides unique visitor count
   - Returns daily visit data for the last 30 days

2. **POST /api/visits** - Records a new visit
   - Accepts session ID and user agent
   - Checks for duplicates (same visitor within 30 minutes)
   - Stores anonymized IP hash

3. **GET /api/visits/history** - Returns visit history
   - Supports pagination
   - Can filter by date range
   - Returns detailed visit information

4. **DELETE /api/visits** - Clears all visit data
   - Admin-only functionality
   - Requires confirmation

### Frontend (index.html & script.js)

**Homepage:**
- Added "Total Visitors" stat card in the hero section
- Automatically loads and displays visitor count on page load
- Smooth animation when counter updates

**Admin Panel:**
- New "Website Visit Statistics" section appears after login
- Shows summary statistics in a grid layout
- Displays visit history in a sortable table
- Includes refresh and clear buttons

### Data Storage
- Visit data is stored in `data/visits.json`
- Each visit record includes:
  ```json
  {
    "id": "unique_id",
    "timestamp": "2026-05-01T14:30:00.000Z",
    "ipHash": "anonymized_ip",
    "sessionId": "session_identifier",
    "userAgent": "browser_info",
    "referrer": "source_website"
  }
  ```

## Usage Instructions

### For Website Visitors
Nothing special needed - the counter automatically tracks visits when someone loads the homepage.

### For Admin Users

1. **Access Admin Panel:**
   - Navigate to `admin.html`
   - Login with credentials (default: admin/admin123)

2. **View Visit Statistics:**
   - After login, scroll down to see "Website Visit Statistics" section
   - View summary stats at the top
   - See detailed visit history below

3. **Manage Visit Data:**
   - Click "Refresh" to update statistics
   - Click "Clear All" to reset all visit data (requires confirmation)

## Privacy & Security

- **IP Anonymization:** IP addresses are hashed and never stored in plain text
- **No Personal Data:** The system doesn't collect names, emails, or other personal information
- **Session-Based:** Uses session IDs to prevent over-counting
- **Time-Based Deduplication:** Same visitor isn't counted multiple times within 30 minutes

## Technical Details

### Files Modified/Created:

1. **server.js** - Added visit tracking API endpoints
2. **index.html** - Added visitor count display
3. **admin.html** - Added visit statistics section
4. **script.js** - Added visit tracking and statistics functions
5. **Style.css** - Added styles for visit statistics tables
6. **data/visits.json** - Created automatically to store visit data

### Browser Compatibility
- Works in all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Graceful fallback if server is unavailable
- Responsive design for mobile devices

## Testing the System

### To see the visitor counter in action:

1. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

2. **Open the website:**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
   - You should see the visitor count in the hero section

3. **View admin statistics:**
   - Go to `http://localhost:3000/admin.html`
   - Login with admin credentials
   - Scroll down to see visit statistics

4. **Test multiple visits:**
   - Refresh the homepage multiple times
   - Notice that visits within 30 minutes from the same browser aren't double-counted
   - Open the site in different browsers to simulate different visitors

## Customization Options

### Adjust Duplicate Prevention Time
In `server.js`, modify the `isDuplicateVisit` function:
```javascript
// Change 30 minutes to desired time
const thirtyMinutesAgo = Date.now() - (30 * 60 * 1000);
```

### Change Statistics Display
In `script.js`, modify the `loadVisitStatistics` function to show different time periods or metrics.

### Customize Table Columns
In `script.js`, modify the table HTML in `loadVisitStatistics` and `loadVisitPage` functions.

## Troubleshooting

### Visitor count shows "1,000+"
This is a fallback displayed when the server is not available. Make sure:
- Node.js is installed
- Server is running (`node server.js`)
- No errors in browser console

### Admin statistics not loading
Check:
- You're logged into the admin panel
- Browser console for any API errors
- Server is running and accessible

### Data not persisting
Ensure:
- The `data` directory exists
- Server has write permissions to create `visits.json`
- No file system errors

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

If you want to extend this system, consider:
1. **Real-time updates** using WebSockets
2. **Geographic tracking** (country/city) using IP geolocation
3. **Page-specific tracking** (which pages are visited)
4. **Visit duration tracking** (how long users stay)
5. **Export functionality** (download visit data as CSV)
6. **Charts and graphs** for visual analytics
7. **Bot/crawler detection** to filter out automated traffic

## Support

If you encounter any issues or need help customizing the visit counter:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify server is running
3. Ensure `data/visits.json` file exists and is writable
4. Review the code comments for customization options
